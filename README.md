# Real-Time Weather Information & Data Logger

This project is a Python-based application that retrieves **real-time weather information** using the OpenWeatherMap API, displays formatted weather details to the user, and logs each weather record into a CSV file along with a timestamp.  
The project demonstrates **API integration**, **data logging**, **error handling**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.
